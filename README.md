# C++ Booth Multiplier example
## 4 bit Booth multiplier.
Attempt at a simple example of Booths Algorithm for multiplication. Created this to develop a better understanding of the algorithm while I work on developing a logic circuit that does the same thing.
### Future Goals:
- [ ] Implement actual Test Cases
- [ ] Implement into a logic circuit 
- [ ] SetUp Variable Multiplier Sizes
