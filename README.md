# C++ Fast Arithmetic examplea
## 4 bit Booth multiplier.
Attempt at a simple example of Booths Algorithm for multiplication. Created this to develop a better understanding of the algorithm while I work on developing a logic circuit that does the same thing.
## 32 bit Goldschmidt Divider
Attempt at creating a C++ version of Goldschmidt Algorithm for division. Want a better understanding to fix issues in a logic circuit implementation.
### Future Goals:
- [X] Implement actual Test Cases
- [X] Implement into a logic circuit 
- [ ] SetUp Variable Multiplier Sizes
